      "During the internship, the primary mission was to enhance a tool for calculating the usage of supercomputers. \n The key objectives of this internship were as follows: \n * *Data Collection* : The primary task involved **retrieving data from a website and a terminal**, related to the usage of machines utilized by CNRS and CINES. The data needed to be extracted, standardized, and stored in a database for subsequent analysis. \n * *Data Analysis* : Subsequently, an analysis of the data was carried out with the aim of **monitoring the daily usage** of each user. This analysis is made available through daily **email reports** to laboratory heads and on a dedicated website. \n * *Website Restoration* : Another responsibility was to restore the functionality of a website utilizing the Django framework. The website's code was reorganized by implementing the **Model-View-Controller** pattern to enhance code structure and maintainability. \n * *SQL Query Optimization* : It was also necessary to rethink the SQL queries used for data storage to make them **more efficient** and **facilitate code maintenance**. \n\nTools : Python, Django, Git, Pandas, Numpy, Sqlite3",
